            <h3>The Idea : :</h3>
            <hr class="title-hr1">
            <p>I wanted to re-create the very first coding project I worked on without even knowing. This is how I was introduced to coding. Iâ€™ve always been someone that looks for improvements, in pretty much anything, especially when being very system based. When I occupied my first CS role in iGaming, I had already found a few things that I could have improved on, and one of them was the message technique the company used to have.<br>
                <br>
                The system specifically used for the replies (for me) was slow, and the alternative way of using these canned replies was via word (decent alternative, not the best), so I spoke with a colleague of mine and we started working on something. Turns out we built a rough web page with the most canned replies used which is copied with one click and we can swiftly paste it in the chat, yet back then, a small part of me knew what I was doing, so now that I have more knowledge, I wanted to re-create it by myself while also making it responsive to different sizing. </p>

                <div class="html">
                    <div class="col1"> I have changed the HTML structure quite a few times, as I didn't work with any specific design, just a brief idea I had in mind. At the time that I was working on this project I hadn't gained the HTML structure knowledge I have now, so I'm pretty sure that next time round, I can improve this project with better structure, nonetheless, I'm still happy with the outcome. </div>

                    <br>
                    <div class="col2"> I initially worked on this prooject using <a href="https://codepen.io/alphaura/pen/oNaqvyq">codepen.io</a> thinking desktop first, however, only later I came across that it's a bit weird to make the site responsive on codepen and also remembered that I used to use this in a small window, therefore, thinking desktop first wasn't the brightest idea, as it became somewhat messy, when I got to the @media query part. For the content I used ChatGPT to help me get some rough canned replies used within the iGaming industry, and named my casino as "Amaz1ng Cas1no". <br>

                <div class="css">
                    <div class="col1">I kept the CSS part fairly simple as the biggest function of this project is mostly the JavaScript part. Since I started desktop first on this project (ideally started mobile first), I had to work around this fix with the media queries. Overall, I mostly workedo on making the buttons and sections display flex, so that they take proper spacing.</div>

                    <br>
                    <div class="col2">For the JavaScript part, I have searched for how to make a click-on-copy function. After I understood the code, I made the required changes so that it works how I wanted to. At the writing of this post, my JavaScript knowledge is still in the beginning, however, I'm happy that I managed to understand the code and make it work for me.<br>

                    <div class="col1">It WORKS, while not as good as I want to, it works. It serves the purpose it was created for, which is to amplify the quickness of a reply to a customer. Using flex has made the buttons more responsive, however, the text is still affecting the size, so will need to re-design the project and improve on it.</div>

                <h4>-- Medium/Desktop Screen Sizes --</h4>
                <div class="desktop">
                    <div class="col1">For bigger sizes, I believe that it works just fine, as the spacing is much better, mostly due to it being initially designed with the desktop-first mindset, so it does make sense that it works better on a desktop. I made the sections flex as well, so to reduce the scrolling needed to go from one section to the other.</div>

            <h4>-- Final Touches --</h4>
            <p class="final">After doing most of the work, I was seeing that the scrolling part, especially on smaller sizes was slowing me down and not providing the best experience, so I decided to add a navigation menu that is linked with the sections so that the user clicks on the section needed and he will go directly to it with the least scrolling possible.</p>
