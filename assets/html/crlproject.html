            <h3>The Idea : :</h3>
            <hr class="title-hr1">
            <p>This project was the final challenge of a 21 day course I did about responsive design. I was provided with the deisgn PDF and some specific specs on what to include in the project. I took this project, as if it was my first official project, which technically is the most complex (although simple looking) project I did so far.<br>
                <br>
                This is because I focused on mobile-first design, and wanted to make my first proper responsive design for multiple different device screens. </p>

                <h4>-- HTML --</h4>
                <div class="html">
                    <div class="col1"> I started the project by linking the design on the desktop to how the HTML structure could be, in order to have a solid code structure that makes sense and that will also help me later on when I get to the CSS part. </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="col2"> I have grouped some text that had the same color and font sizes together with the same class not only to have them changed at one go, but to also reduce the amount of code I need to write.<br>
                        <br>

                <div class="css">
                    <div class="col1"> After I structured my HTML which took me around 30-40 minutes, I then started working on the CSS part, where I started from top to bottom thinking mobile-first, which was the first time for me. In the previous projects or challenges that I worked on, I've always worked desktop-first, so this was another challenge in itself. </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="col2"> I started by laying design structure out by adding the [padding] between the sections, gave background colors to the [section classes], and content container sizing to the [container] classes of the sections. This has helped me layout the design structure nicely, to also understand it how it's going to look.<br>

                    <div class="col1"> After the design structure was done, I started going through each section individually (always looking at mobile-sizing for now) and setting up the needed font sizing and families, text colors, padding and margins between the content, text alignment. </div>

                    <br>
                    <div class="col2"> For mobile-first, I barely used any display CSS rule, because the site was doing its own thing for me. I have only used display: flex; 3 times; </div>

                - In the hero banner, to use the [align-items] trick to center the content inside the container due to the [min-height] rule<br>
                <br>
                - For the footer to have better spacing and layout of the content<br>

                    <div class="col2"> I then continued to work on the main breakpoints and comparing to how the design should be. Here is where I intentionally used more the display: flex; option to arrange the layout of how the content looks on bigger screen sizes. </div>
