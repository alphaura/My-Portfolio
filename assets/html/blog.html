                    <p> My very first coded blog post on my personal website!<br>
                        <br>
                        Let me introduce myself, my name is Kyle and I am a front-end web developer. I've been on many (many) different journies which have thought me ample of things,
                        about myself, life, perspectives, mindset, and success. All of this has led me to this current stage. Here I am at 25 years old, working as a full-time CS, finishing my last season of football coaching, while studying with ICE Malta to become a certified front-end dev.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is only the beginning of a successful journey, and career path. I enjoy doing my own graphical designs and animations for my projects and search tools are just some of my bestfriends that I use to aid me in developing beautifil projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to have a talk about what I could improve on or if you simply want to connect and have a nice chat ðŸ«¡</p>

                    <h2>Blog-002</h2>
                    <p>The below is a LinkedIn post I made earlier today. I'm a very curious person when it comes to work and on how I can improve my possibilities to improve, grow and learn. Most of the job opportunities I came across that had only <span style="font-weight: 600">"Front End Developer"</span> in them caught my eye, so I looked into them. <br>
                    <br>
                    It's crazy that most of these positions were asking 2 - 5+ years of experience  and a good amount of languages and technologies to know beforehand, the below is a list of only 1 job application.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proficiency in Front-End technologies including TypeScript, Redux, Node.js, Angular and Material Design.</li>
                        <li>Experience in an OO language such as Java and in JavaScript tooling (Webpack or Angular CLI).</li>
                        <li>Understanding of basic web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, SASS / LESS, CSS.</li>
                        <li>Experience in Unit and Integration test (Jasmine, Karma).</li>
                        <li>Cognisant on REST services.</li>
                        <li>Experience with Agile (Scrum, Kanban) Development.</li>
                        <li>Proficient use of Linux.</li>
                        <li>Exposure to Backend, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, as well as Geo mapping software will be considered an asset.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If I'm applying for my first job and see something like this, it could put me off, and most probably not apply for (or if I still had my previous mentality, not even think of reading and understand what these requirements even were).<br>
                    <br>
                    While the above list does look huge with a lot of things required, that has helped me to understand further requirements I could look into, to put myself in a better position to get the opportunities I'm looking for and to evolve myself.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And rememeber, if you hit 50% of what is required and confident enough, JUST GO FOR IT!</p>
